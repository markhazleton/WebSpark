Works

*   [The Economics of the Sulphur Industry](https://www.amazon.com/Economics-Sulphur-Industry-Routledge-Revivals-ebook/dp/B019H24HT6/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1544364184&sr=1-2)  
    
    > Between the 1950 s and 1970 s, the Sulphur industry continued to grow despite occasional shortages and excesses. In this study originally published in 1970, Hazleton focuses on the Frasch sulphur industry to explore issues such as competing sources of sulphur, the possibilities of sulphur being obtained as a result of pollution-abating policies and the conditions under which future supplies are likely to become available. This title will be of interest to students of Environmental Studies."

    > Macroeconomic policy involves government action intended to influence the overall operation of the economy and to deal with such important public problems as economic growth, inflation, unemployment, and recession. In this first comprehensive treatment of presidential management of such policy for any presidency, authors James E. Anderson and Jared E. Hazleton focus on four tasks: developing and maintaining an information and decision-making system; coordination of policies in different macroeconomic areas; building support or consent for presidential policies; and administrative leadership. Drawing extensively upon presidential documents and interviews with Johnson administration officials, the authors pay particular attention to fiscal, monetary, wage-price, and international economic (especially balance of payments) policies during Johnson’s terms. The authors use the concept of the subpresidency, as defined by Redford and Blisset in Organizing the Executive Branch: The Johnson Presidency (University of Chicago Press, 1981), to show how Johnson managed the macro-economic institutions of the council of Economic Advisors, the Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management and Budget), the Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve Board in pursuit of his economic goals. What emerges is a vivid portrait of an activist president. In evaluating management of macroeconomic policy in the Johnson administration, the authors focus on how presidential policies are developed and adopted rather than on the substance of the policies themselves. They conclude that the Johnson administration competently managed policy development during its presidential years. This book is a volume in the Administrative History of the Johnson Presidency Series sponsored by the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, the first two volumes of which were published by the University of Chicago Press. Managing Macroeconomic Policy: The Johnson Presidency was funded in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

    > A mathematical goal programming model is described for the purpose of normative policy evaluation of environmental land use management on the Texas Gulf Coast. The model's three‐level hierarchy, linking statewide, multicounty, and local models, allows the explicit consideration of competing goals (policies) at different spatial scales. Microlevel impacts of macrolevel environmental policy decisions, and vice versa, can be assessed.

    > The events of 1973 in the Middle East, which culminated in a nearly four-fold increase in the posted price of oil, have generated a good deal of concern about the need for recycling of oil revenues. Most of the discussion to date has focused on the problem from the standpoint of oil-importing countries. Comparatively little attention has been given to problems facing the major oil-exporting countries. This paper examines planning problems in the context of sudden affluence. It centers on the implications for development planning of the gold rush phenomenon which characterizes the oil-exporting countries of the Middle East in general, and the desert economies of the Persian/ Arabian Gulf in particular.

    > No single issue has so captivated public attention in recent months as concern over deterioration of the environment. Problems of environmental pollution, land use planning, population control, and resource sufficiency have come to dominate the public forums of the nation. Awareness of these problems has created increased demands for the development of public policies for controlloing the environment.

    > An important land reform effort was undertaken in Jordan in 1959 in connection with the development of the East Ghor Canal Project in the Jordan Valley. The historical background and pattern of land reform in Jordan was similar in many respects to that found in other areas in the Middle East. The purpose of this article is to describe the land reform measures and to evaluate thier impact on land redistribution and tenure and on agricultural output and living standards in the project area.
    
*   [Cost Effectiveness of Alternative Year Schooling. Final Report](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED354629)  
    
    > This study describes the major forms of year-round education, evaluates their potential costs and educational benefits (including effects on student academic achievement, learning retention, socialization, and employability), and assesses such programs' feasibility as to legal requirements and effects on school personnel and the larger community. Year-round education (YRE) or year-round schools or schooling (YRS) often connote two different alternations to the traditional school calendar: (1) increasing classroom time by extending the school year or the school day; and (2) rearranging the traditional 180-day school calendar to provide more frequent and shorter vacation periods. Research indicates that substantial increases of classroom time would result in some improvements in academic achievement, but would be very costly. Single-track YRE programs (all students in school or vacationing at the same time) now account for 46 percent of all YRE programs. The normal 3-month summer break may hinder learning retention, particularly for disadvantaged youth. Multitrack YRE programs offer potential capital savings due to more efficient facilities use; single-track YRE programs can be more expensive than 9-month calendar schools. A telephone survey of 1,003 Texans indicates weak commitment to YRE, but favorable disposition toward trying it. Another informal survey showed that 41 Texas school districts were operating some form of YRE (mostly single-track programs) and that teacher response is positive. Recommendations for further implementation of year-round programs in Texas are provided.

    > While there appears to be widespread agreement that schools need to use time more effectively to improve learning opportunities, education research is needed on the cost and results of using time differently. Presents a cost-simulation model to determine the relative costs of a year-round program. (MLF)
    
*   Public Policy toward Bank Mergers: A Legal and economic evaluation  
    
    > Public Policy toward the banking industry has undergone significant changes since 1960. Guided by two acts of Congress and a number of court cases, a new public policy toward bank mergers has emerged. In contrast to over a century of regulatory policy designed, at least in part, to restrict competition in banking, the new merger policy seeks to promote competition among banks.
