    "Ingredients": "- Big bunch of kale (or chard) \n - Olive Oil  \n  - Salt \n - Pepper",
    "Instructions": "Wash and shake dry a big bunch of kale or chard. \n  Break off and discard the stems. \n  Cut across the leaves to make wide shreds. \n  Line baking sheet with foil and spray or brush with bit of oil. \n  Spread greens evenly on baking sheet, and bake @ 350 for 15-20 minutes, stirring them up once or twice. \n \n  When the greens bake, they become bright green and quite crisp. \n   (Cooked a minute or two less, the kale is chewy-crisp;take your pick and adjust the cooking time to taste.)   \n  Once the crunch is out of the oven, you can salt or season it, but is very good plain. \n \n  The crunch is best the day it is made but will keep a day or two in a tin at room temp. \n \n  **NOTE**: My 3 year old loves this, and eats them like potato chips! \n \n \n  Recipe courtesy of Mollie Katzen",

    "Instructions": "1. Season the chicken with the lime juice, 2 teaspoons of ancho chile powder and a dash of salt. In a skillet heated on medium, cook the chicken in the olive oil on each side for about 10 minutes.  \n  2. When chicken is done (after about 20 minutes), shred it with two forks and set aside. Taste and see if it needs more salt and pepper. Should yield about 3 cups.  \n  3. Melt the butter in a saucepan on medium, and add the onions, red bell pepper and poblano pepper. Cook for 10 minutes.  \n  4. Add the garlic, flour, cumin, cayenne pepper and 2 teaspoons of ancho chile powder, and cook for 1 minute.  \n  5. Add the chicken broth and cook on low until mixture is thickened, a few minutes. Stir in the half-and-half and Ro-Tel cover the pot, and simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  \n  6. Uncover the pot, and add the sour cream, 2 teaspoons of lime juice and 1/4 cup of cilantro, and add salt and pepper to taste. Turn off heat.  \n  7. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  \n  8. Heat up the tortillas (you can do this by adding a bit of oil on an iron skillet and then cooking the tortillas for about 30 seconds on each side).  \n  9. Ladle 1/2 cup of the sauce onto the bottom of an 11 x 7 inch baking pan.  \n  10. Layer half the tortillas along the bottom of the pan (on top of the sauce). To make sure entire pan is evenly covered, you can rip some of the tortillas into strips to fill any gaps.  \n  11. Add half the chicken, half the remaining sauce, half the remaining cilantro and 1 1/2 cups of grated cheese.  \n  12. Repeat the layering, leaving the cheese layer on top.  \n  13. Cook uncovered for 30 minutes or until brown and bubbling. Serves 6-12, depending on how big a portion you distribute. Goes great with sour cream and cilantro on top.  \n  ",

    "Instructions": "Put two tablespoons olive oil in the Dutch oven and heat on high.  Cut the onions in half and remove the ends and outer layer of skin.  Once the oil is very hot, place the onions face down and sear for 1 to 2 minutes.  Then turn the onions and do the same on the outside.  Once done, remove to a plate.  Take the carrots, wash them, remove ends and then slice in 2 inch pieces.  Do not peel.  Put carrots into the hot Dutch oven and sear.  About 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove to plate.  While carrots are searing, coat the pot roast with sea salt and pepper.  Make sure to really cover the roast entirely.  Bring the oil back to temperature and then put the roast in to sear.  About 2 to 3 minutes.  Then turn and sear other side.  While searing the roast, make up the package of au jus and bring to a boil – make the au jus with 4 cups of water instead of 3.  Remove roast to plate.  Take ¼ cup red wine and a quarter cup water and deglaze the pan.  Make sure to get all the bits off the bottom and into the liquid.  Next return the roast to the Dutch oven.  Add 3 cups of au jus over the roast.  Then put the onions and carrots on top of the roast.  If using a 3 pound roast, don’t add the 4th cup.  If cooking a 4 to 5 pound roast, then add the remaining cup of au jus.  Now cover Dutch oven and put into an oven at 275 for 3 to 4 hours (depending on size of roast).    \n    \n  When you remove roast, let cool for 15 minutes.  Then take roast, onions and carrots out.  Keep liquid in pan and heat.  Take 2 cups of water and ½ cup flour to make a white wash.  Mix into the drippings from the roast and heat for gravy.  \n    \n  Serves 5 to 8 depending on size of roast.  \n  ",

Rub meat with sea salt and season pepper using 1 tablespoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of season pepper on each side.  Take 3 to 4 cloves of garlic and insert fully into the roast (cut a small slit in the meat to insert the garlic).  Please roast into pan and sear for 5 minutes on each side.  \n    \n  While searing meat, slice the yellow and red peppers making thin half inch slices, slice the medium onion in half and make thin slices of onion and dice garlic.  Put these vegetables into the bottom of the crockpot or Dutch oven.  Next add tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, green chilies, oregano, garlic salt, cumin and vinegar.  Then mix together until well blended.  Begin heating the crockpot to high or heat the Dutch oven on the stove.  Once the meat is seared on both sides, place the meat into the pot or Dutch oven and turn over to make sure both sides are covered in sauce.  As the sauce heats, mince the cilantro removing most of the stems and making sure that the ones you keep are well minced.  Put ¼ cup of the minced cilantro into the pot or Dutch oven and roll the roast again to make sure cilantro is on the top and bottom.  \n    \n  If using a Crockpot, be sure to get the sauce up to the point it is bubbling and then turn to low.  The roast should cook 7 to 8 hours on low.  If using a Dutch oven, then once it is heated and the sauce is bubbling; cover and put the entire pot in the oven at 275 degrees leaving to cook for 6 hours.  Cook until the roast is very tender and falling apart.  \n    \n  When you remove the roast and it is tender and falling apart, use two forks to shred the roast and mix with the sauce.
