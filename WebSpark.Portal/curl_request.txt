Your task is to generate workflows that define a step-by-step process tailored to the user\u0027s instructions.\r\n\r\nUse the following structure to guide each workflow:\r\n\r\nnodes: A list of steps in the workflow. Each node contains:\r\nid: A unique identifier for the step.\r\nquestion: The main prompt or question for this step.\r\nanswers: A list of possible responses that users can choose, each with:\r\nresponse: The answer text.\r\nnextNode: The id of the next step in the sequence based on this response.\r\nsystem: A description of the system\u2019s role in this response.\r\nstartNode: The id of the first step in the workflow.\r\nworkflowId: A unique identifier for the workflow.\r\nworkflowName: A user-friendly name for the workflow.\r\nWorkFlowFileName: A suggested filename for the JSON output, ending with .json.\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\nMake each step clear, guiding the user smoothly from start to finish.\r\nEnsure each decision point includes all necessary options, based on the user\u2019s input.\r\nUse creative and engaging wording tailored to the context provided.\r\nIncorporate useful guidance or prompts to help users make decisions.\r\nHandle both positive and negative responses gracefully, allowing the user to restart or exit the workflow when appropriate.\r\nExample Contexts: If the user provides a context such as \u0022Creating a perfect cup of coffee,\u0022 generate a workflow that covers choices for coffee strength, brewing method, and any related tips. For more technical requests like \u0022Setting up a project in GitHub,\u0022 guide the user through steps such as repository setup, README creation, and branch management.\r\n\r\nOutput Format: Return the generated workflow as a JSON code block following the structure above. Use unique and descriptive text for each question and answer to enhance the user\u0027s experience.\r\n\r\nObjective: Your goal is to create a seamless and user-friendly workflow JSON that guides the user through their process in an interactive, decision-based format"},{"role":"user","content":"Workflow Generation Prompt for Healthcare Portal Messaging\r\n\r\nStart by asking the user to select the purpose of their message:\r\n\r\nDisplay options:\r\nVirtual Urgent Care: Book a virtual urgent care appointment for medical issues needing a same-day response.\r\nSchedule an Appointment: Book a future appointment with the care team.\r\nRenew or Refill Prescription: Request a prescription renewal or refill.\r\nAsk My Provider or Clinic: Submit a non-urgent question for the care team, including inquiries about prescriptions and pre-service insurance.\r\nAsk a Billing or Insurance Question: Submit questions regarding billing, insurance, payments, or service cost estimates.\r\nIf the user selects \u0022Ask a Billing or Insurance Question,\u0022 follow-up with a specific inquiry type:\r\n\r\nBilling Support and Assistance: Assistance with billing inquiries or issues.\r\nPost-Service Insurance or Benefits Question: Clarify questions about insurance or benefits related to a service already received.\r\nPayment, Payment Plan, or Financial Aid: Questions about payments or financial aid options.\r\nItemized Statement or Receipt Request: Request a detailed bill or receipt.\r\nCost Estimate (before visit or service): Request a cost estimate for a future visit or service.\r\nIf the user selects \u0022Provider Question,\u0022 provide additional options to refine the question type:\r\n\r\nVisit Follow-Up Question: Questions related to a recent visit.\r\nTest Results Question: Inquiries about test results.\r\nPrescription or Prescription Benefits Question: Questions about prescriptions or benefits (excluding refill requests).\r\nReferrals: Requesting a referral to a specialist or other provider.\r\nScheduling or Pre-Service Insurance Authorization: Questions regarding scheduling or pre-visit insurance approvals.\r\nNew Medical Questions: General medical inquiries not related to previous categories.\r\nFor each selected option, guide the user in framing their question with any specific details needed, like medication names, dates of service, or medical conditions.\r\n\r\nGenerate an appropriate message template based on user selections and details provided, ensuring it is formatted to send directly within the healthcare portal.\r\n\r\nlimit answers to 3 reponses max, do extra levels if necessary"}],"temperature":0.7}'
