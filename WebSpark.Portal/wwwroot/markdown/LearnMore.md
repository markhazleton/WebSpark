Our History
-----------

Prompt Spark was inspired by a deep fascination with the capabilities of AI to mimic human conversation and a desire to showcase the dual nature of technology. The project, initiated in Wichita by Mark Hazleton, an AI enthusiasts and developer.

The project was conceived as an educational tool to explore and explain the nuanced potential of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT).

Mark Hazleton wanted to contrast the positive and negative potentials of AI. He crafted two distinct personas for the platform: Wichita Wisdom, representing the thoughtful and constructive use of AI, and ICT Sarcasm, depicting a more critical and satirical approach. The contrasting nature of these personas serves as an allegory of Charles Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities," highlighting the dualities within AI technology.
