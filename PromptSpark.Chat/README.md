## üîç Overview

PromptSpark.Chat combines modern web technologies and AI capabilities to create an intelligent chat interface that can be tailored for various use cases. Its workflow-based architecture allows administrators to define conversational flows as a series of connected nodes, creating structured interactions for different scenarios.

The platform supports:

- Real-time streaming of AI responses
- Multiple workflow definitions for different conversation scenarios
- Visual workflow management and editing
- Integration with OpenAI's advanced language models

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-Time Communication**: Powered by SignalR for instantaneous message delivery and streaming AI responses
- **AI-Driven Conversations**: Integration with Microsoft Semantic Kernel and OpenAI to provide contextual, high-quality responses
- **Workflow-Based Architecture**: Define and manage conversation flows through a configurable workflow system with nodes and connections
- **Visual Workflow Management**: Admin interface with flowchart visualization using Mermaid.js
- **Extensible Design**: Support for custom node types and conversation patterns
- **Multiple Workflow Templates**: Pre-defined templates for various conversation scenarios (medical, troubleshooting, general assistance)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 9.0
- **AI Integration**: Microsoft Semantic Kernel 1.41.0
- **Real-Time Communication**: SignalR
- **API Documentation**: Scalar for API reference

### Frontend

- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap
- **JavaScript Libraries**: jQuery
- **Flow Visualization**: Mermaid.js for workflow diagrams
- **Data Tables**: DataTables for tabular data presentation

### External Services

- **AI Provider**: OpenAI API (with support for gpt-4o by default)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

PromptSpark.Chat follows a service-oriented architecture with the following key components:

### Controllers

- `HomeController`: Manages the main user interface views
- `WorkflowAdminController`: Handles workflow administration functionality
- API Controllers:
  - `ConversationController`: Manages conversation state and history
  - `WorkflowController`: Handles workflow operations and node navigation

### Services

- `ChatService`: Integrates with Semantic Kernel to generate AI responses
- `ConversationService`: Manages conversation state, history, and workflow progression
- `WorkflowService`: Loads, saves, and manages workflow definitions
- `PromptSparkHub`: SignalR hub for real-time communication

### Workflow System

The core of the application is the workflow system, which consists of:

- **Workflow**: A collection of nodes and a designated start node
- **Nodes**: Individual steps in the conversation, containing:
  - Questions or prompts to present to users
  - Possible answers/responses
  - Links to next nodes in the flow
- **QuestionTypes**:
  - `Options`: Multiple choice selection
  - `OptionsWithText`: Multiple choice with free text input
  - `Text`: Free-form text input
  - `Message`: Simple message display

### Data Flow

1. Client connects to the SignalR hub
2. Workflow is loaded based on configuration
3. Conversation starts at the designated start node
4. User interacts with the current node
5. System navigates to the next node based on user input
6. AI responses are generated using Semantic Kernel and streamed to the client
7. Conversation history is maintained throughout the session

## üîÑ Workflows

Workflows are the heart of PromptSpark.Chat, defining the conversation structure and flow.

### Workflow Structure

Workflows are defined as JSON files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "workflowId": "1",
  "workflowName": "Sample Workflow",
  "startNode": "1",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "question": "How can I help you today?",
      "questionType": 0,
      "answers": [
        {
          "response": "I need technical support",
          "nextNode": "2",
          "system": "You are a technical support specialist."
        },
        {
          "response": "I have a general question",
          "nextNode": "3",
          "system": "You are a helpful assistant."
        }
      ]
    },
    // Additional nodes...
  ]
}
```

### Question Types

- **Options (0)**: Multiple choice options
- **OptionsWithText (1)**: Multiple choice with text input
- **Text (2)**: Free-form text input
- **Message (3)**: Display message to user

### Pre-defined Workflows

The application includes several pre-defined workflows in the `wwwroot/workflows` directory:

- `chatassistant.json`: General-purpose chat assistant
- `troubleshoot.json`: Technical troubleshooting workflow
- `medicalmessage.json`: Healthcare-related assistance
- `hospitalmessage.json`: Hospital information workflow
- `coffee.json`: Coffee ordering demonstration
- `promptspark.json`: PromptSpark platform assistance

### Workflow Administration

The workflow administration interface (`/WorkflowAdmin`) provides the following features:

- View and select available workflows
- Add, edit, and delete workflow nodes
- Visualize workflow connections using flowcharts
- Tree view of workflow structure

## üìù API Documentation

PromptSpark.Chat uses Scalar for API documentation and includes the following API endpoints:

### Conversation API

- `GET /api/Conversation/init/{workflowName?}`: Initialize a new conversation
- `POST /api/Conversation/chat`: Send a chat message
- `GET /api/Conversation/{conversationId}`: Get conversation state

### Workflow API

- `GET /api/Workflow/init`: Start a workflow
- `GET /api/Workflow/{nodeId}`: Get node details
- `POST /api/Workflow/next`: Navigate to next node

To access the API documentation, run the application and navigate to `/api/reference`.

## üß© Extending the Platform

### Adding Custom Workflows

1. Create a new JSON file in the `wwwroot/workflows` directory
2. Define your workflow structure following the schema
3. Access your workflow through the administration interface or API

### Creating Custom Node Types

To extend the available question types:

1. Add new enum values to the `QuestionType` enum in `Workflow.cs`
2. Update the frontend to handle the new question type in `site.js`
3. Implement the corresponding UI components in the chat interface

### Customizing AI Behavior

You can customize the AI behavior by modifying:

- The system prompt in each workflow answer
- The default model in `appsettings.json` or environment variables
- The chat completion implementation in `ChatService.cs`
