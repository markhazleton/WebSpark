## Summary of Changes Made to OpenAIFileAnalysisService

I have successfully modified the `OpenAIFileAnalysisService` to support a list of already uploaded CSV files. Here are the key improvements:

### ðŸš€ **Key Features Added**

#### 1. **File Management System**

- Added `UploadedCsvFile` class to track file metadata (ID, name, path, upload date, size)
- Maintains an in-memory list of uploaded files (`_uploadedFiles`)
- Files are now loaded into AI and kept available for reuse

#### 2. **New Methods for Multi-File Operations**

- `UploadAndRegisterCsvFileAsync()` - Upload and register files for future use
- `AnalyzeUploadedCsvFilesAsync()` - Analyze specific files by their IDs
- `AnalyzeUploadedCsvFilesByNameAsync()` - Analyze files by their names
- `AnalyzeAllUploadedCsvFilesAsync()` - Analyze all uploaded files together
- `GetUploadedFiles()` - Get list of all uploaded files
- `RemoveUploadedFileAsync()` - Remove specific files
- `ClearAllUploadedFilesAsync()` - Clear all uploaded files

#### 3. **Enhanced Single File Analysis**

- Modified `AnalyzeCsvFileAsync()` with `keepFileUploaded` parameter
- Option to keep files in the system for future analysis

#### 4. **Multi-File Message Support**

- Added `PostMessageWithMultipleFilesAsync()` to handle multiple file attachments
- Supports analyzing multiple CSV files in a single AI conversation

#### 5. **Enhanced Controller**

- Updated `CsvAIProcessingController` with new actions:
  - Upload with keep option
  - Analyze selected files
  - Analyze all files
  - Remove individual files
  - Clear all files

#### 6. **Improved User Interface**

- Enhanced view with file management table
- File selection checkboxes for multi-file analysis
- Custom prompt input for tailored analysis
- File metadata display (name, date, size)
- Bulk operations support

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Improvements**

1. **CSV Files are Pre-loaded**: Files are uploaded to OpenAI and kept available, ensuring they're loaded into the AI before processing
2. **Memory Management**: Maintains file list in memory with proper cleanup options
3. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for missing files and invalid operations
4. **Metadata Tracking**: Tracks file information for better management
5. **Reusability**: Files can be analyzed multiple times without re-uploading

### ðŸ“‹ **How It Works**

1. **Upload Phase**: CSV files are uploaded to OpenAI and registered in the service
2. **Storage Phase**: File IDs and metadata are stored in the service's memory
3. **Analysis Phase**: Users can select any combination of uploaded files for analysis
4. **AI Processing**: Multiple files are attached to a single conversation thread
5. **Cleanup Phase**: Files can be individually or bulk removed when no longer needed

### ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits**

- **Efficiency**: Upload once, analyze multiple times
- **Comparative Analysis**: Analyze multiple datasets together for insights
- **Cost Optimization**: Reuse uploaded files instead of re-uploading
- **User Experience**: Intuitive file management and selection
- **Flexibility**: Support for both immediate and deferred analysis

The service now provides a complete file management system for CSV analysis with OpenAI, ensuring files are properly loaded into the AI before processing and supporting sophisticated multi-file analysis scenarios.
